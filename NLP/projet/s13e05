No cameras!  We're never on camera!  Honey, why are you upset?  I'm excited about being a grandmother!  Of course you are.  Society celebrates women as they age.  It's different for men.  Aging just means we're closer to death.  And I've got too much to live for.  I own a Corvette!  [ Engine revs, tires squeal .] Me too!  I just turned the same age as my dad when he died!  [ Tires squeal .]  Good morning, U.S.A.   I got a feelin' that it's gonna be a wonderful day   The sun in the sky has a smile on his face   And he's shinin' a salute to the American race   Oh, boy, it's swell to say   Good --  Good morning, U.S.A.    What's all this?  I felt bad about how I reacted  to your wonderful news yesterday.  So I'm cooking breakfast for my sweet daughter.  Aww, thanks, Dad.  or should I say "Grandpa".  [ Blender whirs .] Fresh squeezed O.J.?!  Great!  I've never tried it blended!  [ Blender shuts off .] Enjoy!  You know, Stan,  Tropicana makes an O.J. pre-mixed with birth control --  Country style, tons of pulp.  Mmm.

What is that pink scum on top?  That means this orange juice is for a girl.  Dad, this was supposed to be a romantic getaway.  I've got my partner  Men: [ Chanting .] Chug, chug! Chug, chug!  So, where's yours? He's in the Jacuzzi.  Do you dare me to put my wiener in the jet?  I do.  [ Children shouting playfully .]  Hey, sluggers! I'm Mark!  I run the Kidz Klub for the hotel.  You cool dudes should join us.  We're making a hippo boat out of milk cartons.  Mark, Mark, Mark.  Looks like you got a great thing going here, Mark.  A week ago, I'd be rooting around your Kidz Klub  like a pig in shit.  However, I'm about to be an uncle.  So I'm looking for something a little more mature.  Oh. I see.  Well, if you change your mind, we'll always be here for you!  Don't bring that desperation to my boy.  He's about to be an uncle.  You're a freakin' joke, buddy.  Huh! That's what I thought.  You know, this whole resort feels like a Kidz Klub to me.  This isn't the real Bahamas.  Yeah, I was feeling that, too,  but you really put a bow on it.  Klaus, if I want to give worldly uncle advice,  I got to get out in the real world.  Didn't they say it's dangerous outside of the resort?  Those warnings are for kids, Klaus.  [ Screams .]    [ Thud .]  [ Glass squeaking .]  I don't know why you're doing what you're doing,  but it has to stop.  Hayley, I didn't want to have to do this,  but I forbid you from having a baby.  I'm too young to be a grandfather.  Well, don't worry about it. You're never gonna be one.  Ah, what a relief. [ Chuckles .]  Hey, what do you say you and me go pet that manta ray?  Because  when I have a baby, you won't be part of its life.  Hey! No running on the pool deck!  Did I get her?  [ Thud .] Nope.  [ Sighs .]  Rough one, too?  I'm miserable, even though I've achieved every actor's dream --  performing in a hotel water show.  It's a show about animal cruelty.  I play the villain, Animal Strangling Johnson,  while Tyler gets to play the hero, Ranger Ron.  You don't know what it's like  to have 200 people boo you every night.  The most boos I've ever gotten  was like 60, maybe 70 people.  I would do anything to get to play Ranger Ron.  Anything.  I get it.  I would do anything to keep my daughter and son-in-law  from having a baby.  Even murder?  - What? - Eight Coronas, Jimmy.  Oh, hey, Stan.  Us lifeguards are having a big bonfire on the beach later.  You should come. But don't bring that guy.  He strangles animals. Boo!  Talking to you reminds me of a fun idea I had once.  Stan: Does it? You're not having that effect on me.  Now, let's say that you'd like to kill off your son-in-law.  This isn't the fun idea, then?  But you can't, because you'd get caught.  But let's say, hypothetically,  two fellas with no connection at all meet up,  and they swap murders --  hypothetically, of course.  Do you know what "hypothetically" means?  Let's say hypothetically, I do.  We good? I think so?  But do not kill my son-in-law.  I can't be any more clear about that.  You got it. Great.  You know, I was just thinking about it,  and the fact that you winked at me  makes me think that you might  want to sleep with me.  And although I'm flattered,  and maybe even a little bit curious,  um, I am a happily married man.  And, um, I'm gonna have to say  no.  Did you say something?  Okay.  [ Birds chirping .]  So, your story is that you just walked away  from the Atlantis Resort?  Yes, th-- That's right.  Could I get a glass of water? It's very humid.  You expect me to believe that you left seven pools,  a casual dining bistro, and a turquoise shop?  That's everything a little boy could dream of  unless that little boy is a D.E.A junior agent!  What? The D.E.A wouldn't even have jurisdiction down here.  Mr. D.E.A. quoting from the D.E.A handbook.  Kill them and feed them to the pigs.  Aah! Please don't kill me!  I'm gonna be an uncle!  Wait. You're going to be an uncle?  Why didn't you say so?  I am an uncle myself.  I'm gonna be the best uncle ever.  Next to me.  My niece is so cute. She can't say "mosquito."  She says "momito."  "Uncle Drake, I am covered in momito bites."  [ Laughs .]  You know, I've been looking for an uncle type  to step up in my organization.  Joining a violent drug gang.  I don't know.  Raising a child is expensive.  A rich uncle could really help out.  Listen to your fish. Hmm.  You're not gonna sell this to any white people, are you?  Not directly.  I'm in!  [ Cellphone buzzes .]  [ Groans .] Who's texting me this early?  [ Cellphone chiming .]  "Whoa! How about you just chill?"  Surfer emoji.  Should I put a snowflake on there to really sell the chill?      Oh, God. I got to find Jeff!  [ Door opens .]  Where am I?  A hotel room!  You're getting a lot better at drinking, Francine.  Jeff's not in his room.  All right, if I'm gonna find him, I've got to think like him.  Okay, I'm a 20-year-old stoner trying to bang my daughter.  Where would I go?  Donny!

I feel, like, super-disconnected from the family.  I mean, Hayley said that thing about me being "nearby,"  and it got me spinning out, and I feel like -- Hold on.  [ Inhales deeply .]  I feel like I'm trying to make the gang a new family,  but the "Razor" thing?  mean, it's just -- just not a home run yet.  What? Ridiculous!  You're "the Razor"!  That means something around here.  Maybe just a little less coke,  a little less threatening people's toes.  Who says I'm doing too much coke?!  Okay, shoes on, everyone. Razor's in one of his moods.  [ Groans .]  Here you go, old-timer.  [ Groans .]  [ Straining .] Got to find Jeff.  [ Blows whistle .] Hey!  Where'd you get that popsicle?  Is that a Rocket Pop?  They told me they were out.  [ Blows whistle .]  Damn it, Roger! My ears!  Bitch got my pop!  Eh?  Give us back our ball! Eh?  God, I hate old people.  Get him!  Eh? [ Indistinct shouting .]  No!  [ Dramatic music plays .]  It has come to my attention  that we're light on product this month.  Someone is ripping me off!  Who do you think it is?  My money's on Mateo.  [ Grunting .]  Just give me the word, and I'll cut him.  I'll do it in the town square.  That way, everyone knows who runs this [bleep.] island.  Shut up! I know it was one of you two.  And you're both going to die.  I knew it was a mistake to mix business and uncles.  I told you we'd always be here for you, Steve!  Glue guns now, gang!  [ Groaning .]  [ Tinkle! .]  Way to go, P.J.!  We're all helping equally.  Come on, Steve.  I didn't know Kids Klub was so bad-ass!  You know, I've never lost a kid.  [ Screams .]  Steve: You're amazing, Mark!  Mmm!

[ Laughs .]  Isn't it ironic that I forget that your minds were erased?  [ Laughs .]  Anyway, Jeff's brain is in an alien body.  It was a whole thing in space.  And nobody but me knows. And now you.  And the guy who's behind us who won't stop eavesdropping!  We know you're not asleep, buddy.  Sorry. I'm just naturally curious. [ Door opens .]  Wow, Jeff. That was amazing.  Look, Mr. S.! I fell in the toilet!  Are you sure about this?  That your daughter's married to an alien with superpowers?  Yeah, babe. Superpowers?!   That's right, Dadders. Jeff has superpowers.  Tune in next week and see if we deal with that.  And maybe Reginald will come back.
