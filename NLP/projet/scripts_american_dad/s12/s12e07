I know.  Have I told you that story before?  Uh, yeah. Beep, beep. Let's go.  Sir, thank you for getting me an assistant.  Don't thank me. Have your assistant do it.  Asher! I wanted the water room-temperature  but not this room. I meant a slightly colder room.  Oh, I'm so sorry. I-i'll get an ice cube.  That's your generation, isn't it?  An ice cube will fix everything.  Well, not this time. You're fired.  But before you go, bring me an ice cube.  That does sound nice.  Sir, I'd like you to meet the newest member of the C.I.A.,  which makes him eligible for the C.I.A.'s calendar --  Agent Tyrese Gibson.  Thank you for this opportunity.  Now, I've been reviewing some files,  and I think I have a lead on a terrorist attack on U.S. soil.  Your eyes -- they are mesmerizing.  Can I put a shirt on?  I don't think you understand why we brought you here.  This is Dustin, my new assistant.  He's a flincher.  - [ Grunts .] - Two for flinching.  - [ Sneezes .] - Germs!  How dare you not dive in front of the proof book to protect it.  It's like you don't believe in this, or me.  You've got bad energy, Dustin.  All day, you've been silently judging me.  You're fired.  Whoa. You think your dad would hire me?  'Cause I don't have a lot going on  since I lost my frisbee in that scary bush.  It'd be hell to work for my dad.  He has never once said I did a good job.  When I was a kid,  my dad would always take me to the same beach.  So for father's day, I drew him a picture of our beach.  My bedtime story that night  was a 45-minute critique of my drawing.  Well, if it were me,  I would have drawn it on a single piece of paper.  I did. He tore it up. That's how critical he is.  And that day, I vowed that if he ever made anything,  I'd ruin it.  And I forgot about that vow for a long time  'cause, you know, I had other stuff going on.  But now it's back with a vengeance.  Oh! So you're gonna try to ruin his calendar thing.  [ Mockingly .] "Oh!"  [ Normal voice .] Yeah. I'll become his assistant,  and I'll help him make the calendar.  [ Chuckling .] And then when he's feeling all good about it,  I'll destroy it!  Babe, you're scaring me more than the scary bush.  [ Ominous music plays .]  Bro: Neiderhoff!  How was school today, Steve?  You know I didn't go.  I watched you and mom drink two bottles of wine,  and now we're here, and mom's sleeping in the car.  So, you want to go watch your mommy sleep  or help me break in my Discovery card?  I thought this was a stupid choice when you said it,  but I get it now.  10 more minutes, then we go shopping?  Ooh, I'm sorry.  We don't accept Discovery card.  We do take Visa, Mastercard, American Express,  Diner's Club, Traveler's checks,  even a gentleman's agreement to come back and pay tomorrow,  but no Discovery card.  What?! Let's get out of here, Steve.  This place smells like farts, anyway -- or it's about to.  [ Grunts .]  Is there a store here that sells paper towels and underwear?  Discovery card at a tumi store?  You have to be kidding me.  This is tumi.  Tu-mi.  Sorry. Geez.  Tuuumiiiii!  I guess Discovery card isn't as widely accepted as I thought.  Oh, you must be the Discovery card people  I've been hearing about. Right this way.  I think I know what you're looking for.  Steve, are you seeing this door?  Please, sir, don't make this difficult.  I'm going. I'm going.  Aah!  I guess I'll never get that Discovery card jacket.  Man: Psst.  I know a place that takes Discovery card.  [ Gasps .]  Hayley, I don't know why you wanted this job,  but I hope you're motivated enough to handle it.  Oh, I'm plenty motivated.  What was that?  I thought I heard you say something pointedly,  like you were plotting to take someone down,  someone close to you, someone completely oblivious.  - Nope. - Okey-dokey.  Oh, my god. This is quite a production.  Don't pretend like you didn't know  the C.I.A. calendar is a huge deal.  I don't think anyone outside the C.I.A. knows.  You mean the muggles?  We're all set up to shoot "January" with Jackson.  What?! No!  Every year, Bullock goes overboard with the steroids.  We do july first and then drop him off in the woods  so he can work off his aggression in isolation.  [ Woman screams .]  Bullock love body!  Muscle powder!  [ Slurping .]  [ Grunting .]  All right, people, we're only gonna get one of these.  Bullock doesn't like the flash.  [ Grunts .] [ Camera shutter clicks .]  Lightning box!  Aah!  Heads up.  I said heads up.  [ Camera shutter clicks .]  [ Screaming .]  [ Panting .]  Hayley, you saved my life.  And ruined the perfect shot. Way to go.  Wha-- what are you doing?  It's called a slow clap.  Notice the speed my hands are moving.  That's how sarcastic I'm being.  [ Camera shutter clicks .]  Come on, Hayley. Throw him a good one.  - I'm hitting him in the chest. - With the pointy part!  Why don't we just photoshop a ball into his hands?  Only amateurs use photoshop.  You don't know what photoshop is, do you?  I don't have to know what something is  to not like it. You think I know what hummus is?  [ Camera shutter clicks .] Stan, listen.  I've been tracking the terrorists' cellphone chatter,  and I think it's time to go undercover.  Sure, sure. Whatever. Release the bull!  Beautiful.  Hayley, get this bull out of here.  Not so fast.  You're a clown. Make us laugh.  Um  Aah!  [ Laughs .]  I di-- I didn't think she could do it.  Uh, we've already been to this mall.  No one takes Discovery card.  Oh, we're not going here.  For us Discovery card people,  this is our mall.  Starting  right now, this is our mall.    This mall has remained untouched since the '80s.  It's perfect. How can we ever repay you?  Actually, I host this singer-songwriter night - Uh-huh.
