In my blood.  Surprised you don't know about him.  Didn't he leave you the Red Rammer when he croaked?  All I've got of my dad's is a huge shoe  I found in the garage that I think was his.  I wear it around the house sometimes  and pretend I have one really big foot.  It's lame, I know.  Nah, that's normal.  I wear my dead mom's heels around the house  and pretend I have a big ol' vagina.  - Pff. - Was my dad any good?  The best.  He was always slammin' into everybody.  That sounds bad.  Nah, that's how you win.  Destroy the other cars.  I was your dad's spotter  his eyes and ears out there.  [GLASS SHATTERS.]  Car!  [GLASS SHATTERS.]  - Car! - [GLASS SHATTERS.]  - Car! - [THUD.]  Holy crap!
