It's  - It's my day.  Uh, why is everyone acting like it's yesterday?  Because I erased their memories  so they could relive the previous day,  giving them another shot at a decent Father's Day.  You're "Groundhog Day'ing" the fam?!  Wait. Why didn't you erase my memory?  Come on, bud. You're not even on my radar.  So, the family has no idea  they're reliving yesterday's Father's Day?  Nope. Their minds have been whipped clean.  Wh-Whipped clean. Whipped  Whipped clea  Why  Why can't I say this?  I got it. Their minds have been whipped cream.  I feel like we're building to the point  where you tell us how you did this.  - Are we? - We are.  [Twinkle!.] The C.I.A. was having   Wait, wait. Stan, how long is this story?  'Cause I just want to know  do I sit, do I stand?  Medium-long?  Uh, lean.

What happened to Roger? - He went on a vape run, bro.  The house was dangerously low on Vanilla Vacation.  But, Stan, what you're doing feels very unfair to the family.  What's unfair is they forgot Father's Day.  This whole thing is supposed to be a makeup,  and they haven't quite made up.  But I just know they're gonna nail it today.  Almost done with the birdhouse.  Hey, the skylight you wanted  it can be just painted on, right?  Good morning!  Rockin' Ronnie comin' at ya two days after Father's Day.  [Mid-tempo music plays.]  There's nothing that I wanna do   Rockin' Ronnie comin' at ya two days   More than get alone and be alone with you   Rockin' Ronnie comin' at ya   Trouble with dreams is they don't come true   And when they do, they could catch up to you   Good morning!  You don't need a thing from me, but I   I need something big from you   'Cause you know I've got   - # An awful lot of big dreams # - [Repeating.] Good morning!  [Laughs.]  I'm walkin' down a lonely road   Clear to me now, but I was never told  [Laughter.]  OCD, OCD, OCD.

You wake up camera-ready, lucky dog.  Takes me hours to shake that "just woke up" look.  No time for what?  And your morning voice sounds clear as a sparrow!  Me? Forget about it!  No phone calls before noon.  Klaus, I have to get started on my dad's present.  Damn! And no morning breath?  Do you sleep with mints in your mouth?  Now, come on! You're wasting valuable time!  Where'd all this come from?  Check the artist's signature.  "Steve Smith"?  I don't remember making this.  But that's my heart-dotted "I" and eyeballs on the S's  to make them look like scary snakes.  Here it is again!  Every night, your dad resets your memory,  so every morning, you wake up thinking  it's Father's Day again  and again!  Steve, you missed the story of the boy in the volcano.  It riveted the nation for months!  In the end, it turned out to be just a goat in a Starter jacket.  Dad's not gonna get away with this.  Yeah! Dad's lost it.  Klaus, he's not your dad.  Well, well, well.  - Dad! - No.  Looks like you got it all figured out.  W-W-Why are you doing this to us?  W-W-W-W-W-W-W-Why? Why? Why? Why?  Because you guys can't give me one decent day,  no matter how many chances I give you!  Chances? What are you talking about?  Good morning! Rockin' Ronnie   Dad's been tricking us into reliving Father's Day  every day for six months!  [Both gasp.]  You brainwashed us?!  Oh, of course! Make it about you!  Well, since you won't remember this anyway,  I'll get everything out of my system so I can  wake up tomorrow without being so cheesed off!  Go ahead, Steve  cry!  It'd be weirder if you didn't!  [Gasps.] Go ahead, Hayley  gasp.  - It'd be weirder if you didn't! - Stan, enough!  Since when is anything enough for you?  For the last 20 years, you just sit around  and wait for me to bring home money.  "I need rugs. I need bananas."  Stan, stop before you say something you'll regret.  Oh, I haven't even started.  I'm the Scatman   [Scatting.] [Music.]  I'm the Scatman  [Scatting.]  [Scatting continues.]  [Click, music stops.]  You can stop feeling sorry for yourselves,  because this never happened.  [Click.]  Starting now. [Click.]  Now! [Click.]  Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now!  Aw, Stan.  When I was grabbing a snack last night,  I "accidentally" knocked that thing off the counter  'cause it wasn't on my radar.  I  Uh, uh  And I wasn't really getting a snack.  That mission was purely to be a rascal.  Although, I did reward myself with a sleeve of saltines  and four packs of Gushers. Happy Father's Day.  Hey, guys. Uh, I know you didn't think  my jokes earlier were very funny.  Jokes?! What you said was unforgivable!  You can't dissect comedy!  Anyway, I know you're feeling a little down,  so I made you one of my famous apology cakes.  Just pretend SpongeBob is me.  And instead of having amazing adventures under the sea,  he's sorry he insulted his family.  You don't understand. We're never getting past this.  Okay. I knew there was a small chance the cake wouldn't work.  But maybe you'll find this filling more persuasive.  You're all coming with me to the C.I.A.  We have another memory eraser, and I'm gonna use it  to make you forget all the things I said   and the so-called "gun incident."  There's another memory eraser?!  That might be the only way we can be a family again.  I think you can put down the gun, Dad.  We all want to forget.  Roger: Ow!  Bad news  We sold the other memory neutralizer.  No!  Wait. What's in the box, then?  Lil' Angelo!  Oh, yeah, you missed the C.I.A. mascot elections.  Gretchen the Guinea Pig ran a tight race, but I think  we're still a ways off from electing a female mascot.  Dick, do you know who bought the other neutralizer?  Yeah. Got the receipt right here.  - Some C.I.A. collector in Ohio. - Ohio?!  B-But we only have 24 hours from when you said those things  - to get there! - Yeah, If we don't make it by morning,  we're gonna remember all the crap you said forever!  All the jokes.  Look, I know I hurt you guys, but let me make it up to you.  Just because this is a day that you're all going to forget  doesn't mean it can't be a day to remember.  And then forget.  Can you just shut up and focus on driving?  Yep. Driving's pretty cool.  You, uh, want to give it a try, son?  - What? - Yeah, you'll be driving soon.  Stan, leave him alone.  What? I'm doing something nice  father/son.  Here, take the wheel.  [Engine revs.] Aah!  [Tires screech.]  It's just like one of your video games   the ultimate video game.  You only have one life  well, technically, four lives.  Whoop! Guardrail. [All screaming.]  Please tell me you can fix this.  What makes you think I can fix   Oh. 'Cause of the tow truck and the coveralls.  No, no, no, I'm not a mechanic. I'm just a strange man.  [Animals calling.]  Guys, we got one!  Everybody, thumbs out and look sexy.  We don't know who this is or what they're into.  [Tires screech.]  The mouse can never resist the cheese.  [Slurring.] Hey.  - Hey. Hey. - What?  What's your record for Tylenol PMs?  - What do you mean? - What's the most you've ever taken?  I've done seven.  Stan, I think it's your turn to ride shotgun!  Nonsense. My queen always rides in front.  [Smooches.]  Hey.  [Swallows.] Eight.  Hey. Hey. We're good.  The place we're going is just right up here.  [Groggily.] One more right here.   Let me just say thanks to our friend.  He's dead. We have 10 minutes.  Don't get many visitors, but I'm always happy  to show off my C.I.A. memorabilia.  Whoa! Hayley, check it out!  The super crack we introduced in the '80s.  [Gasps.] Look! Steve! The real Jason Bourne!  How do I know how to do this?!  Dad! We only have four minutes!  I believe this is what you came for.  Now let's talk about a fair price.  Okay, we only got 30 seconds.  I'll just zap you, and we can forget  about the worst day of our lives.  You know, I  I meant what I wrote on the cake.  [Voice breaking.] "Bad dad sad."  Aah! That's hot!  Steve, that was our last chance.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but we shouldn't forget this day.  Right! Because we made all these great  new memories today  as a family!  And that's the true meaning of Father's Day.  Are you kidding me?! Today was a disaster!  Well but, then I'm screwed.  You're gonna hate me forever.  Yeah, we want you to feel that way 'cause you've been  working your ass off all day to make things right.  It turns out the only thing that makes you a good dad  - is being a guilty dad. - Yeah.  And that's the true meaning of Father's Day.  - No!! - That's just a character flaw!  Noticing my flaws and my strengths.  Is that the true meaning of Father's Day?  Dad, I'll explain it all in the back of that guy's pickup.  Or better yet  why don't you drive?  You know what, guys?  This is easily one of my favorite Father's Days.  And Christmases.  Did you guys know it was Christmas?
